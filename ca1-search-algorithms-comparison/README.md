# Search Algorithms Comparison
In this assignment, we analyze the performance of three different search algorithms (BFS, IDS and A\*) algorithms on a simple problem. The problem consists of a board, including an ambulance, a number of hospitals and a few patients. There are also some obstacles in the map which alter the routes which the ambulance can take. The goal is to minimize the number of moves the amulance has to make to take every patient to a hospital.
